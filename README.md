It took me roughly a week of part time work on this project since concentrations/focus paths opened up in my classroom.

I liked writing my story the most. I got to relive one of my life's most exciting adventures and it made me realize how much I should have journalized it right after it happened. Making it into a 360 format was fun as well as modifying some truth to tell the story in a way that I would have liked to live it rather that how it actually happened. 

Figuring out the costs to make this into a 5 minute film was challenging. There was just so much that went into an entire day that it felt impossible to condense everything into such a short time. Also, figuring out estimated costs for the project was hard because I didn't know exactly what was needed to make a film since I've never made one before.
