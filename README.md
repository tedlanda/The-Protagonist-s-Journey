It took me roughly a week of part time work on this project since concentrations/focus paths opened up in my classroom.

I liked writing my story the most. I got to relive one of my life's most exciting adventures and it made me realize how much I should have journalized it right after it happened. At least I finally wrote the story. Not all of it being true, by the way.

Figuring out the costs to make this into a 5 minute film was challenging. There was just so much that went into an entire day that it felt impossible to condense everything into such a short time. Also, figuring out estimated costs for the project was hard because just the explosion would run so much more than 50k.
